 * Types of video scaling:
 * SCALE_ASPECT_FIT - video frame is scaled to fit the size of the view by
 * maintaining the aspect ratio (black borders may be displayed).
 *
 * SCALE_ASPECT_FILL - video frame is scaled to fill the size of the view by
 * maintaining the aspect ratio. Some portion of the video frame may be clipped.
 *
 * SCALE_ASPECT_BALANCED - Compromise between FIT and FILL. Video frame will fill as much as
 * possible of the view while maintaining aspect ratio, under the constraint that at least
 * `BALANCED_VISIBLE_FRACTION` of the frame content will be shown.
